ESPDLeap
========

This is a more optimized implementation than my previous attempt at the evolutionary spatial prisoner's dillemma written in C++.

Update
==========
Leap is now functional. If you plan to use this code, see http://sfml-dev.org and https://developer.leapmotion.com/ for information on building a project with these technologies.
